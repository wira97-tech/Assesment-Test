I created this website full of challenges. because initially I had never used the nuxtjs framework before. At the beginning I had to watch tutorials from experts on YouTube so I could understand the structure and syntax of NuxtJS. I initially had difficulty understanding the routing and folder structure used to create this website. But I never gave up and continued to learn so I could at least slic the website and make it a little more dynamic.
